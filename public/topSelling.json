    "description": "The GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 4080 16GB AERO OC Graphics Card, based on the Ada Lovelace architecture and designed to handle the graphical demands of 8K gaming and high frame rates, brings the power of real-time ray tracing and AI to your PC games. The GPU has 16GB of GDDR6X VRAM and a 256-bit memory interface, which provides better performance and power efficiency than the previous Ampere-based iteration. The front panel of the card features a variety of outputs, such as DisplayPort 1.4a and HDMI 2.1. HDMI 2.1 supports up to 48 Gb/s bandwidth and a range of higher resolutions and refresh rates, including 8K @ 60 fps, 4K @ 120 fps, and even up to 10K. The RTX 4080 is not just about high-resolution gaming. Computationally intensive programs can utilize the GPU's 9728 cores to accelerate tasks using CUDA and other APIs. Gigabyte used the WINDFORCE cooling technology for cooling. The three fans rotate in opposite directions to decrease turbulence and boost airflow pressure. When the GPU is running a low-load or low-power game, the 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans turn off. The triangle fan edge splits the airflow, which is then steered smoothly along the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface. The graphene nano lubricant can extend the life of the fans while also making them quieter. It also has RGB Fusion, which includes color customization and a variety of lighting effects. It can also be used to sync with other AORUS devices. The GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 4080 16GB AERO OC GDDR6X Graphics Card comes with a 02-year warranty.",
